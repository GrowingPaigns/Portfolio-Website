# Portfolio-Website

This repository holds the recently completed code for my personal portfolio website. 

I programmed this project myself, and it consists entirely of front-end elements, given that I have no need for back-end features at this time.

The video below is a demo of the website in its current state. Eventually, there will also be a link here that will take you to the website, once I have enough money to host it online.

ℹ️ **Be warned, parts of the video are "laggy", so don't think that is your computer's fault** ℹ️
- The reason this occurs is because I have a lot of media on the website that is not currently compressed, and such takes up a lot of processing power. Normally, when just viewing the page, this lag is not an issue for the user. But combine it with another hungry program like my recording software, and you get the lag you see present in the video.
- I am currently working towards making the code, and my media more efficient, but for now this demo gets the point across.
