# Portfolio-Website

This repository holds the recently completed code for my personal portfolio website. 

I programmed this project myself, and it consists entirely of front-end elements, given that I have no need for back-end features at this time.

The video below is a demo of the website in its current state. Eventually, there will also be a link here that will take you to the website, once I have enough money to host it online.
