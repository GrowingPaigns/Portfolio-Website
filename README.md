# Portfolio-Website

This repository holds recently completed code for my portfolio website.
 It consists entirely of front-end elements, as I do not need a database to host images/videos at this point in time.

_The languages used in this project are..._

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">
        <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html" alt="My Skills"/>
      </a>
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      HTML as the base, as 95% of websites use HTML for their base and there's a wealth of knowledge about it
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">
        <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=css" alt="My Skills"/>
      </a>
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      CSS to style text, buttons, and to create hover animations/effects
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

      </a>
    </td>
    <td align="left">
      JavaScript to create transitionary wipe animations for each project section, as well as implement some Q.O.L. features
    </td>
  </tr>

I released this code publicly, mainly so that potential employers can look over my development style. I also did it, however, so that interested students may learn how to develop their own websites. 
- If there are any such students out there who would also like to ask questions, or discuss this project further, please check out my community discord linked below.
